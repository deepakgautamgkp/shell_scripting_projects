How it works:

Reads all files in the given directory (. by default, or you can pass one like ./organizer.sh /path/to/dir).

Gets file extension, normalizes to lowercase.

Moves files into specific folders (Text_Files/, Images/, etc.).

Files without extension go into Others/.

If extension is unknown, creates a generic folder like MP3_Files/.
